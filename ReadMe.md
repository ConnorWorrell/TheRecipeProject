# The Recipe Project
Finding and keeping track of recipes is a lot of work, so I created this repository to keep track of recipes that I enjoy.
All these recipes are modified from various sources (web, books, etc.) They all include detailed information on the quantity of items that must be purchased to make them, and straight forward instructions how how to cook, eat, store, and reheat each dish.  Some dishes even include recommended sides!
The recipes are used as a reference not detailed instructions, if you don't understand a step, use google to get more detailed instructions.
## How to read a recipe
Every recipe has ingredients listed for a single serving unless specified otherwise. Just multiply every number by the number of servings that you want to cook.
Every recipe contains:
1. **Recommendations** - Contains other recipes or information you should know about
2. **Ingredients** - List of ingredients for 1 serving in standard, metric, and imperial units
3. **Objects** - What do you need to cook the recipe (pans, stove, etc.)
4. **Instructions** - Follow these to cook the recipe
5. **Eating** **Now** - Follow these if you are eating the recipe today
6. **Prep for Eating Later** - Follow this for the portions that you aren't eating today
7. **Eating Later** - Follow these when eating later
